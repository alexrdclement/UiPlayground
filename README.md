UiPlayground is a [Kotlin Multiplatform](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform.html) project to experiment with UI APIs, patterns, and tools within the [Compose Multiplatform](https://www.jetbrains.com/compose-multiplatform) ecosystem.

Previously, this repository contained a set of Compose component, shader, and theme libraries. Those libraries have since been migrated to [palette](https://github.com/alexrdclement/palette).
